## What it looks like

The site at **https://kamal007olica.github.io/obspec/** plays this whole flow as you scroll: six steps, then the stone.

**Obsidian ↔ Figma, both ways.** Search your vault from inside Figma, drop any note onto the canvas as a spec card, link layers to notes, and keep the two in sync — note edits show up in Figma live, and design changes can be sent back into the note.

Nothing leaves your machine: the plugin talks to a tiny local bridge that indexes your vault.

```
Figma plugin (UI + sandbox)  ⇄  Obspec Bridge (localhost:27123)  ⇄  your Obsidian vault (.md files)
```

## Features (deliberately few)

| | What | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Search** | grep-style search over every note: title, path, tags, body. Snippets with highlights, `tag:` `path:` `"phrase"` `-exclude` filters, keyboard-driven. | Search tab |
| **Preview** | rendered markdown, wikilinks (clickable), backlinks, tags, open in Obsidian. | tap a result |
| **Insert / Link** | *Insert spec card* renders the note as a clean auto-layout frame; *Link selection* attaches a note to any layer. | note view |
| **Two-way sync** | status per linked layer: In sync · Note changed · Design changed — and the status chip sits on the spec card frame itself, updated live. *Pull* rebuilds the card / marks the note read. *Send to Obsidian* writes node, size, fill, label and a Figma deep link into the note's `## Design` section (creating the note if needed). | Selection & Linked tabs, the frame |
| **Figma Specs** | *Save as .md for Figma Specs* exports any note as a Spec-ready markdown file; drop it on the canvas and Figma turns it into a native Spec. Everything Obspec writes uses only the blocks Specs understand. | note view (↓ icon) |
| **In Obsidian** | *in Obsidian* next to the results runs the same search inside Obsidian, so the matching notes light up in your vault. | Search tab |

## Run it

**1. Start the bridge** (a tiny local helper that reads your vault for Figma). Pick whichever is easiest:

```bash
npx github:Kamal007OLica/obspec          # no install; builds on first run
```
or, with this folder on your Mac, double-click **`Obspec Bridge.command`**. From a clone, `npm install && npm run build && npm run bridge`.

With no arguments the bridge reuses the vault you picked last time, else the vault Obsidian currently has open. `--vault <path>` forces one.

**2. Import the plugin once.** Figma desktop → Plugins → Development → *Import plugin from manifest…* → `manifest.json`.

**3. Open Obspec.** The first run shows a two-step onboarding: it waits for the bridge, then lists the vaults Obsidian knows about on your computer. Click one, or *Browse for a folder…* (native dialog), or paste a path. Change it any time under ⚙ Settings → Vault.

The plugin talks to `http://localhost:27123`, the only address Figma allows (see `networkAccess` in `manifest.json`). Add `--token <secret>` to the bridge and paste it in Settings if you want auth on top of the loopback bind.

## Local preview (no Figma needed)

```bash
npm run preview      # → http://127.0.0.1:5177
```

Runs the **real plugin UI** and the **real bridge** (against a scratch copy of `examples/vault`) with a mock Figma document. The right rail has five one-click use-case emulations that drive the UI exactly like a user would:

1. Search the vault → open a note → insert a spec card
2. Select a layer → link it to a note
3. Edit the note in Obsidian → status flips to *Note changed* → Pull
4. Select a component → Send to Obsidian → note created with frontmatter + Design table
5. Change the design → *Design changed* → re-send updates the note

`npm run emulate` runs the same five scenarios in headless Chrome and writes screenshots + `report.json` to `preview/shots/`.

## Develop

```bash
npm run watch        # rebuild plugin, bridge and harness on change
npm test             # bridge, search, markdown and note-generation tests
npm run typecheck
```

### Layout

```
manifest.json          Figma plugin manifest (dynamic-page, networkAccess → localhost only)
src/plugin/            sandbox: code.ts (messages, links), speccard.ts, snapshot.ts
src/ui/                plugin UI: ui.ts (state + views), bridge.ts (HTTP/SSE), markdown.ts, app.css
src/shared/            protocol.ts (every cross-boundary type), notegen.ts (markdown written to the vault)
bridge/src/            vault.ts (indexer + fs.watch), search.ts, markdown.ts (frontmatter/wikilinks), server.ts, cli.ts
preview/               serve.mjs, index.html, harness.ts (mock Figma sandbox + scenarios)
examples/vault/        sample Obsidian vault used by the preview and tests
tests/                 node:test suites (run via scripts/test.mjs)
```

### Bridge API

| Method | Path | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | current vault (or `null` on first run), platform, whether a folder dialog is available |
| GET | `/vaults` | vaults from Obsidian's registry + saved config, most recently opened first |
| POST | `/vault` | `{ path }` — switch to (and index) a vault; remembered in `~/.obspec/config.json` |
| POST | `/vault/pick` | opens the OS folder dialog, then switches to the chosen folder |
| DELETE | `/vault` | forget the current vault |
| GET | `/hashes?path=a&path=b` | current hashes for many notes in one call (sync status) |
| GET | `/search?q=&limit=` | ranked results with snippets and highlight ranges |
| GET | `/note?path=` | full note incl. frontmatter, outlinks, backlinks, content hash |
| GET | `/notes?limit=` | recent notes (path, title, mtime, tags, hash) |
| PUT | `/note` | `{ path, content, ifHash? }` — create/overwrite, 409 on stale hash |
| PATCH | `/note` | `{ path, frontmatter?, section?, ifHash? }` — merge frontmatter, replace an H2 section |
| GET | `/events` | Server-Sent Events: `created` / `changed` / `deleted` |

Links are stored on nodes as plugin data (`obspec:link`) with the note's content hash and the layer's design fingerprint, which is how sync state is computed without any server-side state.

## Figma Specs

Figma Specs are markdown-based, and Figma makes a native Spec out of any `.md` file dropped on the canvas. There is no Plugin API for creating Specs directly, so Obspec meets Specs halfway:

- **Note → Spec:** open a note, press the ↓ icon in the action bar. You get `<Title>.md` with the note's body, a source line (path, tags, `obsidian://` link) and no dangling wikilinks or embeds. Drop it on the canvas.
- **Spec card:** the auto-layout frame Obspec inserts is a readable mirror that stays linked and shows its sync status on the frame. Use it when you want the note to live *inside* your design, next to the frames it describes.
- **What we write:** the `## Design` section and generated notes use only headings, lists, quotes, code and dividers — the block set Specs documents — so the same file reads cleanly in Obsidian and in Figma.

## Notes & limits

- `figma.fileKey` is only exposed to private/org plugins; without it the note's `figma_url` is omitted (everything else works).
- Spec cards are a readable mirror, not a markdown renderer: headings, lists, quotes, code and tables are kept; images become `[image: …]`.
- Large vaults: a 6,000-note vault indexes in well under a second; search is ~10 ms and note open is instant thanks to basename and backlink indexes (an earlier version scanned the whole vault per note).
- The bridge binds to `127.0.0.1` and only allows the Figma plugin origin (`null`), `*.figma.com` and localhost via CORS.

## Website

`site/` is a single static page (OffBit display type, Three.js for the obsidian gem) and deploys to GitHub Pages from `main` through `.github/workflows/pages.yml`. Open `site/index.html` in a browser to work on it; there is no build step.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome. For a bug, the fastest route is an issue with the Figma version, OS, and the bridge's console output; or email kr07.work@gmail.com.
